# Architecture (Short)

- **Frontend:** React (functional components + hooks)
- **Bundler:** Vite
- **Styling:** Bootstrap + SCSS
- **Routing:** React Router

This is an SPA that expects to call a backend API for data persistence and authentication. Keep the UI stateless where possible and add API clients under `src/services/` when integrating a backend.
